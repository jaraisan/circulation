# circulation
Data and GrADS scripts associated with "Effect of atmospheric circulation on surface air temperature trends in years 1979-2018"

The README file, the scripts and the GrADS data descriptor files are in the file "circulation.zip". Unpacking this with "unzip circulation.zip" creates the directory "circulation" together with the individual files.

The three netcdf data files (T_anomalies_ERA5_1979-2018.nc, T_anomalies_circ_1979-2018.nc and T_trends_CMIP5_42mod_1979-2018.nc) must be downloaded to the same "circulation" directory for the GrADS scripts to work.

See the README file within "circulation.zip" for further information.
